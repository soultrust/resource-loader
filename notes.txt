I had to downgrade to node version 16
higher versions did not work

*Data loaders*

CurrentUserLoader 
loads only one user and that one user is hard-coded.

UserLoader 
improves upon CurrentUserLoader
loads one user by userId passed in as placeholder

ResourceLoader
improves upon UserLoader
Loads any resource, not just users.
Good stopping point for most applications.

DataSource 
goes further into abstraction
passing in the async callback function

DataSource (second instance)
uses DataSource in a different way. 
uses it to get an item in local storage. 
to make this work, you have to set a localstorage item (message: 'Hi from localstorage!')
